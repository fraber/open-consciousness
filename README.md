This repo contains supporting material for a paper tentatively titled
"A Proxy Metric for Functional Consciousness Using Self-Models."

The paper proposes a proxy metric for functional consciousness—
not in the sense of “what it feels like to be human,” but as a 
practical model of an agent’s behavior. The approach is based on 
enumerating the self-models that an agent implicitly or explicitly incorporates.

## Functional Self-Model Analysis (FSMA)

To identify and qualify self-models, we introduce a novel reasoning 
framework called Functional Self-Model Analysis (FSMA).
FSMA is a reasoning method that determines the minimal set of self-models required for a given cognitive or computational function.

This repository includes the datasets used in the empirical analysis for this paper.

## Files

### `self-models.md`
A structured list of identified self-models, organized by area.  
Each entry includes:
- **Key** — unique identifier
- **Name** — descriptive title of the self-model
- **Type of Data** — category or domain it relates to
- **Description** — brief explanation of the model’s function

### `the-mark-on-the-wall.md`
An annotated version of Virginia Woolf’s 1917 short story *“The Mark on the Wall.”*  
This literary text exemplifies a stream of consciousness as the narrator reflects on a 
mysterious mark on the wall. Annotations highlight the occurrences and types of self-models 
identified through FSMA.
